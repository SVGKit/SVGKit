/**
 * SVGKit's version of NSImageView - with some improvements over Apple's design
 
 WARNING: CAAnimations are NOT supported
 - because of the way this class works, any animations you add to the SVGKImage's CALayerTree *will be ignored*. If you need to animate the elements of an SVG file, use SVGKLayer instead (although that class is missing some of the features of this class, and is a little harder to use)

 Basic usage:
 - as per NSImageView, simpy:
 - SVGKImageView *skv = [[SVGKImageView alloc] initWithSVGKImage: [SVGKImage imageNamed:@"image.svg"]];
 - [view addSubview: skv];
 
 Advanced usage:
 - to make the contents shrink to half their actual size, and tile to fill, set self.tileRatio = CGSizeMake( 2.0f, 2.0f );
 NOTE: I'd prefer to do this view UIViewContentMode, but Apple didn't make it extensible
 - to disable tiling (by default, it's disabled), set self.tileRatio = CGSizeZero, and all the tiling will be side-stepped
 - FOR VERY ADVANCED USAGE: instead of this class, use the lower-level "SVGKLayeredImageView" class, which lets you modify every individual layer
 
 Performance:
 - NOTE: the way this works - calling Apple's renderInContext: method - MAY BE artificially slow, because of Apple's implementation
 - NOTE: you MUST NOT call SVGKImage.CALayerTree.transform - that will have unexpected side-effects, because of Apple's implementation
 (hence: we currently use renderInContext:, even though we'd prefer not to :( )
