/**
 SVGKSource.h
  
 SVGKSource represents the info about where an SVG image's data came from ... from disk, from URL, from raw string - or anywhere
 
 ----
 NOTE: you should avoid instantiating SVGKSource directly; it is better to instantiate one of the subclasses, both because this
 allows faster / more direct reading of raw data, and because it preserves the information about "where" the SVG was loaded from.
 ----
 
 Once it has been parsed / loaded, that info is NOT PART OF the in-memory SVG any more - if you were to save the file, you could
 save it in a different location, with a different SVG Spec, etc.
 
 However, it's useful for debugging (and for optional "save this document in same place it was loaded from / same format"
 to store this info at runtime just in case it's needed later.
 
 Also, it helps during parsing to keep track of some document-level information
