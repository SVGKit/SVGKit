 This extension is used by SVGPathView to make a call recurse down the whole document stack
 
 It is *probably* better to re-factor this somehow, to somewhere - but for backwards compatibility,
 I'm leaving it in, and enabled by default. All the code is encapsulated in this one category, so
 it's pretty clean at the moment
